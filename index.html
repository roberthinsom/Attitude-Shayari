        <p>(Translation: Someone who doesn't understand their own worth,<br>
            How will they understand the world?<br>
            In life, if you don’t recognize yourself,<br>
            What will you learn from others?)</p>

            और जो कभी भी पीछे मुड़कर नहीं देखते।"
        </blockquote>
        <p>(Translation: We never bow down before anyone,<br>
            And we never stop out of fear.<br>

            And never look back.)</p>

            उससे क्या डरना।<br>
            वो जो हमारे खिलाफ खड़ा था,<br>
            उसे तो मिटा दिया है मैंने।"
        </blockquote>

            हमारी चाहत तो तुम्हारे बस की नहीं।<br>
            जब हम मोहब्बत करते हैं,<br>
            तो पूरी दुनिया को भुला देते हैं।"
        </blockquote>
        <p>(Translation: You won’t be able to understand us,<br>
            Our love is beyond your reach.<br>
